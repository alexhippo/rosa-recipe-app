## Method

1. Grease a loaf pan; line with baking paper.
2. Beat butter, sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until paler and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until just combined, then mashed banana and maple syrup.
3. Sift over flour, baking powder, soda, cinnamon. Stir with a large spoon until combined. Spoon into pan; smooth the surface.
4. Bake for 55 mins at 160Â°C or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave in pan for 10 minutes before turning, top-side up, onto a wire rack to cool.

## Notes

- make sure the banana is not too ripe, otherwise the banana bread will end up being too sweet
- mash banana as much as possible so that there aren't many solid bits in the bread
- use slightly salted butter so that we don't need to add in extra salt
