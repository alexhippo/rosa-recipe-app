## Method

1. Line a baking tray with baking paper.
2. Mix the almond meal and sugar in a large bowl.
3. Add the egg whites and lemon zest and mix through to create a paste (using your hands is best here).
4. Pinch off pieces of paste and shape into rectangles or mini medallions
5. Place onto the lined tray, leaving room for spreading.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes 180Â°C or until the cookies look slightly marked and the bottom is firm.
7. Cool on a rack. These biscuits keep for weeks in an airtight container, so you can double the ingredients if you like and make a bigger batch.

## Notes

- can use the zest of any citrus fruit - orange, lemon, lime all work
