## Method

1. Grease and line a 9x5 or 8x4-inch loaf pan with baking paper 
2. Melt together chocolate and butter in the microwave in short bursts with frequent stirring until completely melted, smooth and glossy. 
3. Beat egg with sugar, vanilla and salt in a large bowl with a whisk or electric mixer for several minutes until pale, thick and fluffy. If using a mixer it will take 2-3 minutes. 
4. Beat in warm chocolate mixture until evenly blended. 
5. Sprinkle in flour and fold it in until well incorporated and smooth. 
6. Spread batter into prepared pan and sprinkle dark chocolate chunks on top if you have any. 
7. Bake for 16-24 minutes for 180Â°C until a skewer inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

## Notes
- If you have a true 9x5-inch pan, the brownies should take just 16 minutes but if your pan is slightly smaller, they may need up to 25 minutes.
